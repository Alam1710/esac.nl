setup esac_website dev environment for windows
a line starting with > is line you should execute in your command line, the rest are instructions

install xampp: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
install nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
install git: https://git-scm.com/download/win
install phpstorm: https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/

setup system environment variables for directories where you installed: 
	php (xampp), probably C:\xampp\php
	mysql (xampp), probably C:\xampp\mysql\bin
	git, probably C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin

You need php to install composer:
install composer: https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe

Pick a folder where your project will be located, we call this folder <project>

open command window, navigate to <project>
git clone https://github.com/niekaa/Esac_website

Navigate to our google drive and download the .env file: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3Yb0JKalH7CVVkyM0ZaVXdFUmc
place the .env file in your <project> folder

open xampp
go to apachi config, select httpd.conf
if port 80 is already taking, change the port setting: 
	Listen 5005
change the directory line:
	DocumentRoot "<project>\public"
modify the underlying line:
	<Directory "<project>\public">
save the file and close it	

Open mysql admin via xamp
add new database, call it esac

Open command window
>cd <project>
>composer update
>php artisan migrate
	(for me this didnt work the first time, i had to change the password in the .env file to ''
>php artisan db:seed
>npm install
	(you might get some warnings here but they shouldn't be harmfull, errors are though)
>bower install
>npm install --global gulp-cli
>Gulp
>php artisan storage:link
Tim still had to do the following:
>php artisan key:generate

If everything worked you should be able to see the esac website when navigating to http://localhost in your webbrowser
